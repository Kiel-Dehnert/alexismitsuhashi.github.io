                    <p> This project was completed for a capstone class at Inworks, a Human-Centered Design 
						school at the University of Colorado Denver. 

						Access to healthy food and fresh produce is a significant indicator of health and prosperity for a community. Supermarkets are a primary resource for such foods at prices that can be affordable to families and individuals that struggle economically. Unfortunately, such underserved communities can often be located in food deserts; according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, these are areas where at least 33% of the population in a census tract lives more than one half mile from a supermarket<sup>1</sup>. According to the CDC, this “can negatively affect health outcomes”<sup>2</sup>.
					 </br></br>
					   
				
							In order to combine my two independent majors, I focused on solving the question: How can GIS help 
							organizations that address food insecurity? To answer this question and create an MVP, 
							I reached out to local organizations within Denver that work towards increasing nutritional 
							awareness and proving healthy food options for underserved neighborhoods. The two farms that 
							I worked with are Groundwork Denver and The Growhaus. 

					</br></br>

							Going through the user-centered design process, I sat down with the Director of Urban 
							Farms at Groundwork Denver and we were able to identify policy-making for food security 
							as an area that could benefit from visual GIS aids that illustrate a lack of food availability 
							and changes in demographics that impact healthy food availability. Through working with 
							another member of the Groundwork team and looking at studies of gentrification indicators,
							 we identified rising incomes and rental rates as some of the largest consistent indicators
							 of gentrification.

                        <p> Median household income in the past 12 months (in 2016 inflation-adjusted dollars) was 
							obtained from the American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates for 2012-2016 provided 
							by the U.S. Census Bureau. Denver Food Store locations data was obtained from the City 
							and County of Denver’s Open Data Catalog and was updated January 2018. A one mile buffer 
							was created around each census tract and the number of supermarkets within that one mile
							 buffer were calculated (one mile was used since this is another distance used by some
							  USDA tools and narrowed the scope to neighborhoods most affected). The number of grocery
							   stores within one mile was then plotted against median income of those block groups.

						<p>This scatterplot illustrates that increased supermarket access is correlated to income. Adding a linear regression provides that for each $5,544.28 increase in income, there is an average increase of one more supermarket within a mile of a block group. A family or individual with an income of $45,482 can on average expect to have no supermarkets within one mile of their home. 

						</br></br>
						These results quantify one aspect of food injustice in Denver. These increased distances to supermarkets perpetuate health problems and reinforce the cycle of poverty. Addressing food injustice needs to be a priority in closing wealth gaps and supporting all our citizens. Some ideas for further exploration could include looking at race or educational attainment as driving factors of access.
