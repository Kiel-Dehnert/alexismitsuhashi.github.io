                    	Access to healthy food and fresh produce is a significant indicator of health and prosperity for a community. 
		    	Supermarkets are a primary resource for such foods at prices that can be affordable to families and individuals that struggle economically.
		    	Unfortunately, such underserved communities can often  be food deserts; these are areas where more than 33% of the population in a census tract lives more than one mile from a supermarket.
		   
		    
		        In order to combine my two independent majors, I focused on solving the question: How can GIS help organizations that address food insecurity? To answer this question and create an MVP, I reached out to local organizations within Denver that work towards increasing nutritional awareness and proving healthy food options for underserved neighborhoods. The two farms that I worked with are Groundwork Denver and The Growhaus. 
                        Going through the user-centered design process, I sat down with the Director of Urban Farms at Groundwork Denver and we were able to identify policy-making for food security as an area that could benefit from visual GIS aids that illustrate a lack of food availability and changes in demographics that impact healthy food availability. Through working with another member of the Groundwork team and looking at studies of gentrification indicators, we identified rising incomes as the most direct indicator of gentrification.
